# Node.red-poolController
Pool Controller to replace Aqualink RS Controller, works with Jandy rs-485 pumps and Century V-Green rs-485 pumps.  Designed to be able to control pumps via rs-485 EPC Modbus Communication Protocol.  

First, I have to give credit to other folks on the internet for finding refrence documents contained in here detailing the "GEN3 EPC Modbus Communication Protocol" and how to use it to communicate to Century vgreen pumps and other rebranded Century pumps such as Jandy Flopro vs, etc.
